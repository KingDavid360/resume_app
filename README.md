# Resume App

This is a simple mobile app of my resume which shows my name, location, skills and social media handles. The app works with light mode, dark mode and the system theme mode. The app can also work with three languages which are; English, Spanish and Dutch.

## Code base
The app was built using flutter framework and dart programming languages

## Design
The design of the is a single paged app that shows eevery detail necessary in a single page. The app could be set in light and dark mode. Here's the link to the ui design that inspired me: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/462604192971991059/visual-search/?x=16&y=12&w=530&h=397&cropSource=6&imageSignature=8c5463ddcd19361a0ac254a273025de3 

## Libraries used
flutter_localizations: sdk: flutter, intl: ^0.17.0, cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  provider: ^6.0.4 . I used the flutter_localization and intl package to suport the langaueg change in the app, I also used the provider package so as to set the theme for both dark and light mode of the app, and lastly i used cupertino so as to support the normal flutter properties.
  
## Future additions
I'd like to add the option for different users to be able to create their own resume with the app.

## Problems
I faced problems with the the dark and light mode theme, but i got passed it through consistent research. Also had issues with uploading to appetizer, but my fellow track members helped me with it.
